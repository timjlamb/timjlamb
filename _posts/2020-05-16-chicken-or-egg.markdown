The answer is obvious.  The chicken!  Hang on a minute …This old brain teaser is understood, when someone has a dilemma and calls it a “chicken and egg” situation.  If an English phrase doesn’t make sense, it is probably because it is connected to an old proverb or conundrum ; (see above).

Other familiar English phrases can have surprisingly different meanings, even in different English speaking countries.  “Under the weather”, for example, means unwell in the UK; but in South Africa it can mean “drunk”! English is full of phrases with strange or culturally archaic histories; “ Hit for six” means shocked to a stand still.  But did you know, it is a sporting metaphor from the very English game of cricket, when the cricket ball is hit completely outside of the field!?

Another rich source is rhyming slang, often historical.  If someone asks if you are telling them “porky pies,”  how will you know  that they mean “lies”?  There are lots more like that one.  Your language undoubtedly has phrases which will astonish the rest of us.  The best one I heard recently comes from Kazakhstan; translated it means you are “hanging noodles from my ears”.  It seems that it really means “ you are lying to me!”. What fun expressions from your language can you tell us about?  Do please send them in, to tim@timjlamb.com.

As you can see, phrases can conceal cultural and historical back- stories.  If time changes things, we could ask when was English first spoken, which language was first spoken, and who spoke it?!  So, we come back to the question … Which came first, the chicken or the egg?  A strange answer I found earlier this week said “neither; the dinosaur came first”.  I find that difficult to swallow; (the answer not the dinosaur).  What do you think?
