Here at home in England, I have been eating and cooking more! Perhaps you have, too ? Some call the reason quarantine, some call it lockdown. What ever you call it in your language, some find this time at home great, others find it very hard. Not everybody has more free time; in fact some are busier than ever before. I mean doctors and nurses, of course.
Even so we know that most of us the rest of us are eating and therefore cooking more.

Did you know, that in English we use cooking words a lot as metaphors? For example:

If you get really busy in the kitchen cooking lots of fresh food and favourite dishes, even experimenting with new recipes, you are “cooking up a storm”?

Not literally of course! But everybody knows what you mean. It means you are doing a fantastic job!

Of course, Cooking can be very creative as well as communicative . Through making a special meal for someone special , you can let them know just how special they are to you. Even how you prepare the table with maybe a little flower for decoration, tells a lot. But above all, cooking and eating can be fun and yummy.

Some English cooking phrases are quite funny: if you tell a friend he has cooked his goose, he knows he is in trouble with you !! And if he then tells you he is boiling over, he means he is angry with you. You can always tell him to put it on the back burner; meaning you will talk about it another day..
There are other fun cooking terms we use in normal English conversation to mean other things. Do you have such metaphors in your language? What do they mean?
Send your example to english@mrtim.co.uk and I will print it. You can also send me your favourite recipe!

And “that’s just for starters “!

Your English friend,
Mr Tim
