2020 – How will we all look back on this extraordinary year?!So far,  (and yes, I know there’s still a while to go) the events of 2020 have been mind-boggling. They include Australian bushfires  with burning forests and animals, Prince Harry “leaving” Royal Duties in the UK, the coronavirus pandemic wave #1, the impeachment of President Trump, disgrace for a Hollywood film mogul, the BLM movement coming to the foreground, murder hornets arriving in the USA from Asia, a massive explosion of ammonium nitrate in Beirut Port killing 190+ people, California wildfires, the death of Eddie van Halen rock icon, the unor3cedeted uproar of the US election, the second wave and apparently coming 3rd wave of covid19, vaccines, tiers, lockdowns . . .

The impact of the pandemic on people’s lives, and of the economic damage from lockdowns,  has led to some people drawing much closer to their loved ones, and yet others parting company because of stress.
An Italian client and good friend of mine says we should always prepare and plan for the worst, but always look for and expect the best. I think his words are really even more true today, and in the days,  weeks and months ahead. An old American showground saying runs “It ain’t over til the fat lady sings.” This means we normally don’t get to decide when it’s over, whatever “it” is.
Here at MrTim’s PepTalk English, we are quietly but seriously planning for strong improvements in our English teaching offering , a) because we think we should always strive for improvement, and b) because competition in the marketplace and jobs arena is going to get so much  tougher,  and more people will want, in order to survive and get ahead,  to improve their English with the help of sympatico teachers who still believe in fun while learning. Yes, it’s still possible!
With all this in mind, we are increasing our offering in 2021 of academic and exam English (IELTS, TOEFL, SAT etc) as well as General English, including our new Accent Improvement Workshop. Plus look out for a new course in “Intercultural Communication with Heart Intent”, a revolutionary new approach to effective communication in business, personal, professional and communal life!
Look out too for really good special offers for full course block bookings – Watch this space!
So let’s all make positive plans for 2021, which are fairly realistic, but also wildly optimistic. Lets pray  for healing, recovery and, yes,  victory! Together we help make the difference!
Your English friend,
Mr Tim
